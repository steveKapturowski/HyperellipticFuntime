*This is a work in progress!*

This library provides utilities for manipulating elliptic and
hyperelliptic curves as a basis for public-key cryptography

In addition, several specialized and generic attacks against
the discrete logarithm problem over arbitrary finite fields are
provided for the purposes of testing crytographic schemes
against common threats.
